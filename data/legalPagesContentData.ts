        content: `
At the heart of our adventure and tourism platform is a commitment to your trust and safety. Whether you're booking a serene coastal retreat or an adrenaline-fueled safari, we ensure that every experience meets the highest safety and ethical standards.

### 1. Vetted Experience Providers

All tour guides, hosts, and adventure companies on our platform go through a comprehensive vetting process before they are approved. This includes:

- Verification of identity and business registration
- Licensing and certifications for activities such as safaris, hiking, diving, or mountaineering
- Reviews of customer feedback and safety track record

Only providers who meet our quality and safety benchmarks are listed on the platform.

### 2. Safety Standards for Experiences

Every experience listed must adhere to our mandatory safety criteria, including:

- Pre-activity safety briefings for participants
- Use of certified equipment (e.g., helmets, harnesses, life vests)

Adventure comes with risks, and being informed helps manage them responsibly.

### 6. Health and Hygiene Measures

In partnership with local authorities and health guidelines, providers must maintain:

- Waste management practices
- Wildlife-friendly codes of conduct
- Experiences that support conservation or local economies

Travel responsibly, and help us protect the places we explore.

### 8. Emergency Support

Should an emergency arise during your trip, our 24/7 emergency support team is here to help. We can:

- Liaise with local medical services or authorities
- Help you get to safety
- Provide follow-up support and insurance documentation

Your safety goes beyond the booking—it’s our full-time responsibility.
